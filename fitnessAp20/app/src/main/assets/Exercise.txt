Doorway Row@1@Arms@doorrow.jpg@Stand near a doorway or vertical pole. Get into a half squat position and hang on to the doorway with one arm. Pull yourself towards the doorway, and slowly return to the starting position. Repeat.
Bench Dips@2@Arms@benchdips.png@Sit on the floor with a step or a bench behind you. Keeping your legs straight and heels on the ground, hold on to the edge of the elevated surface and press yourself up. Slowly lower yourself down by bending your elbows 90 degrees.
Inverted Row@3@Arms@invertedrow.jpg@Head out and find a horizontal bar, or use the underside of a table again. If you’re using a bar grab it with your palms facing away from you, and if you’re using a table grab the outer edges. Pull your body up until your chest meets the surface, and slowly lower yourself back to a hanging position.
Diamond Push Up@5@Arms@diamondpushup.jpg@Place your hands on the ground with your thumbs and index fingers touching to make a diamond shape (hence the name). Proceed to do a push-up while keeping your elbows close to your body. This variation places emphasis on the triceps.
Pull-Up@4@Arms@pullup.jpg@Find a steady pole like structure above your head that can hold your weight. Grab the pole with your palms facing forward, slowly bend your knees so your arms are holding your body weight above the ground. Bend your arms until your chin is above the bar, and then slowly lower your body to the original position. Repeat.
Feet-Elevated Inverted Row@2@Arms@feetelevatedrow.jpg@Should the regular inverted row become too easy, you can make it more difficult by elevating your feet on something such as a chair. Remember to keep your body in a straight line.
Hindu Push Up@4@Arms@hindupushup.jpg@Get into a regular push-up position, but with your feet slightly wider than hip-width. Lift your buttocks into the air while keeping your arms, legs and back straight. Bend your elbows, and as your body approaches the floor arch your back so you are looking towards the ceiling. Straighten your arms, and proceed to reverse the movement.
Wall Sit@1@Legs@wallsit.jpg@Slide your back down a wall until your thighs are parallel to the ground. Keep your back straight up against the wall.
Sumo Squat@2@Legs@sumosquat.jpg@Take a very wide stance and cross your arms in front of you. Begin the squat by sitting back, and focussing on keeping your chest up and knees pushed out. The sumo squat places more emphasis on the hip adductors and abductors than an air squat.
Air Squat@1@Legs@airsquat.jpg@Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your feet facing forward. Slowly sit back by bending the hips and knees until the thighs are parallel to the floor. Keep your weight on your heels throughout the movement and press through them to return to a standing position.
Step-up@1@Legs@stepup.jpg@Find a step or bench, and place one foot on the raised surface. Step up until the front leg is straight, and then return to start by stepping down (don’t jump!)
Static Lunge@1@Legs@staticlunge.jpg@Stand with your hands on the hips and take a long stride forward. Your feet will stay in this position throughout the exercise. Slowly lower your body until the knee of your opposite leg is close to or touching the floor. Push back up into the starting position and repeat with the opposite leg.
Reverse Lunge@2@Legs@reverselunge.jpg@Rather than stepping forward, try taking a long stride backwards to place added emphasis on the hips.
Bulgarian Split Squat@2@Legs@bulgariansplitsquat.jpg@This is a great exercise that can be tricky to master. Stand in front of a raised surface and place one foot behind you (laces down) on said surface. Keeping your torso upright, descend until the knee of your rear leg touches the ground, and then push back up to return to the starting position. Make sure the knee of your front leg doesn’t move past the toes.
Single-Leg Box Squat@4@Legs@singlelegboxsquat.jpg@This is a progression towards the pistol squat that a lot of people will find difficult. Standing in front on a raised surface (such as a chair, stool or step), stand on one leg and sit back on to the surface behind you. Keep your arms out in front of you as a counterbalance and try to keep your torso upright throughout. As you improve at this exercise you can use lower surfaces.
Skater Squat@5@Legs@skatersquat.jpg@Stand on one leg with your hands out in front of you as a counter balance. With your other leg out behind you and a slight forward lean, sit back until the knee of the rear leg comes close to the ground. Quickly push back up to the starting position.
Shrimp Squat@3@Legs@shrimpsquat.jpg@To perform a shrimp squat, begin in an upright position, then bend one knee so you can grab your ankle behind your back (just like you would if you were stretching your quads). From there, slowly lower yourself down until your knee touches the ground, then stand back up.
Glute Bridge@3@Legs@glutebridge.jpg@Lie on your back with your knees bent at 90 degrees and your hands at your sides. Push through your heels and use your glutes to lift your hips as high as possible. Pause at the top and slowly return to the starting position.
Side Lying Clam@1@Legs@sidelyingclam.jpg@Lie on your side with your knees bent at 90 degrees and heels touching each other. Open your knees by flexing your glutes and hold the position. Slowly return to the starting position.
Donkey Kick@1@Legs@donkeykick.jpg@Get down on all fours with your back flat. Kick one leg to the rear and slowly return to the starting position. Repeat with the opposite leg.
Single Leg Romanian Deadlift@3@Legs@singlelegromaniandeadlift.png@Stand up with your feet together. Lower your arms and torso in front of you while raising one leg behind the body. Keep the opposite knee slightly bent and reach the arms as close to the floor as possible. To return to the starting position, raise your torso while lowering the back leg.
Single-Leg Glute Bridge@2@Legs@singlelegglutebridge.jpg@Lie on the floor with your hands at your side. Bend one leg and keep one straight. Perform the bridging movement by pushing through the heel on the floor and squeezing your glutes.
Shoulders-and-Feet-Elevated Hip Raise@3@Legs@shouldersandfeetelevatedhipraise.jpg@Raising both the shoulders and feet makes this exercise considerably more difficult because the hips have to go through a much larger range of motion. Using a raised surface such as a chair or bed for your upper back, place your feet on another surface (such as a stool) that is roughly the same height. From there squeeze your glutes to lift your hips as high as possible, as in other variations of this exercise.
Sit Up@2@Abs@situp.jpg@Lying on the ground with your knees bent, contract your abs to lift your body off the ground. Try to limit movement in the lower back.
Twisting Sit Up@2@Abs@twistingsitup.jpg@It is basically the same as the sit-up, but at the top of the movement bring the opposite elbow towards the knee. Avoid over-rotating, and keep your chest up throughout to avoid excessively rounding your back.
Crunch@1@Abs@crunch.jpg@Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. With your hands behind the head, contract your core and curl your upper back up from the floor. Hold briefly, and then lower yourself back down.
Reverse Crunch@1@Abs@reversecrunch.jpg@Lie flat on the ground with your hips flexed at 90 degree and knees bent. Pull your knees towards your head to lift your buttocks off the ground. Done correctly, this variation recruits more of the lower abs and obliques than the regular crunch.
Flutter Kick@3@Abs@flutterkick.jpg@Start lying on your back with arms at your sides and palms facing down. With your legs extended, lift the heels a few inches off the ground. Engage your core, and make small up-and-down kicks with the legs.
Bicycle Kick@2@Abs@bicyclekicks.jpg@Lie down on the ground with your knees bent and hands behind your head. Lift your legs off the ground and make a pedalling motion. With your hands behind your head, bring your opposing elbow to meet each leg as it comes toward you.
Superman@2@Abs@superman.jpg@Lie face-down on the ground with your arms outstretched in front of you. Simultaneously lift your arms, legs and torso off the ground. Focus on squeezing your glutes throughout.
Bird Dog@5@Abs@birddog.jpg@The Bird Dog is a great core exercise that emphasises lower back strength and balance. Start on all fours with your back flat. Raise one arm forward while simultaneously lifting your opposite leg until both limbs are in line with your torso. Slowly bring your leg and arm back to the starting position and then repeat with the opposite limbs.
Plank@2@Abs@plank.jpg@Lie face down with your forearms on the floor and hands clasped. Extend the legs behind you and rise up on to your toes. Keeping the back straight, tighten your core, quads and glutes and hold the position as long as you can.
Side Plank@4@Abs@sideplank.jpg@On your side, with just one foot and one forearm touching the ground, raise your body up and keep your body in a straight line.
Side-To-Side Push-Up@4@Chest@sidetosidepushup.jpg@Begin in a noraml push-up position, but as you descend lean to one side to add more stress to that side. Switch the side you lean towards with each rep.
Push Up@2@Chest@pushup.jpg@Position your hands shoulder-width apart and brace your core to make your body into a straight line. Bend at the elbows until your chest touches the floor, and then quickly push back up to return to the starting position. Keep your elbows close to your body throughout.
Feet-Elevated Inverted Row@2@Chest@feetelevatedinvertedrow.jpg@Should the regular inverted row become too easy, you can make it more difficult by elevating your feet on something such as a chair. Remember to keep your body in a straight line.
