Bench Dips@1@Arms@bench dips.png@Sit on the floor with a step or a bench behind you. Keeping your legs straight and heels on the ground, hold on to the edge of the elevated surface and press yourself up. Slowly lower yourself down by bending your elbows 90 degrees.
Inverted Row@3@Arms@inverted row.png@Head out and find a horizontal bar, or use the underside of a table again. If you’re using a bar grab it with your palms facing away from you, and if you’re using a table grab the outer edges. Pull your body up until your chest meets the surface, and slowly lower yourself back to a hanging position.
Diamond Push Up@4@Arms@diamond push up.png@Place your hands on the ground with your thumbs and index fingers touching to make a diamond shape (hence the name). Proceed to do a push-up while keeping your elbows close to your body. This variation places emphasis on the triceps.
Pull-Up@4@Arms@pull-up.png@Find a steady pole like structure above your head that can hold your weight.
